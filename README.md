# Minecraft Cubes | Animation

The project consists of a webpage with 15 Minecraft cubes in 3D, each one with an animation that makes them rotate 360 degrees on their own axis. The cubes are tilted -30 degrees on the x axis and move from 0 to -50 pixels on the y axis, creating an up-and-down effect. Even-numbered cubes start normally, while odd-numbered ones have a -2 second delay in their animation.

Each cube has an element underneath that simulates a shadow. This element is a square with an animation that makes it rotate 360 degrees on its own axis, with a 60-degree tilt on the x axis and a scale that goes from 1 to 1.1. Additionally, a blur filter is applied to it, ranging from 5 to 15 pixels. Like the cubes, even-numbered shadows start normally, while odd-numbered ones have a -2 second delay.

Finally, each side of the cubes has images that recreate Minecraft blocks.
